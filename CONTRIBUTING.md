# Contributing to OpenMindWell

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenMindWell! 

## About This Project

OpenMindWell is a **self-hosted, open-source** mental health support platform built by Team ZenYukti.

**Important**: There is **no central hosted instance** of OpenMindWell. Each deployment is independent:
- Users deploy their own instances with their own infrastructure  
- Each instance uses its own Supabase database and HuggingFace API keys
- Users maintain full control over their data and deployment
- No shared public demo exists - this is intentional for privacy and security
