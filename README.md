## 🌐 Deployment

OpenMindWell is a **self-hosted application**. Each deployment requires:
- Your own Supabase account (free tier available)
- Your own HuggingFace API token (free tier available)
- Hosting platform of your choice

### Recommended Deployment Options:

**Option 1: Cloud Hosting (Recommended for production)**
- **Frontend**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (free tier)
  1. Import GitHub repository
  2. Add environment variables from `frontend/.env.local.example`
  3. Deploy automatically from main branch
  
- **Backend**: [Render](https://render.com) or [Railway](https://railway.app) (free tier)
  1. Connect GitHub repository
  2. Set build command: `cd backend && npm install && npm run build`
  3. Set start command: `cd backend && npm start`
  4. Add environment variables from `backend/.env.example`

**Option 2: Self-Hosted (Full control)**
- Deploy on your own VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
- Use Docker containers (Dockerfile included in backend)
- Run with PM2 or systemd for process management

**Option 3: Local Network**
- Run on local machine for personal use
- Great for testing and development

**Important Notes:**
- 🔒 Each user maintains their own database and API keys
- 🌍 No central hosted instance exists
